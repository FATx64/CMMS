# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your
# domain name.

		root * /usr/share/webapps/phpMyAdmin
		file_server
		uri /pma* strip_prefix /pma
		php_fastcgi unix//run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock

	handle {
	# Set this path to your site's directory.
	#root * /usr/share/caddy

	# Enable the static file server.
	#file_server
		reverse_proxy localhost:5000
	}

	# Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
	# reverse_proxy localhost:8080

	# Or serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
	# php_fastcgi localhost:9000
}
